        <h2>Transradial prosthesis using EEG and EMG sensors and signals.</h2>
<br>

<p>
  <b>Research</b>: Look into the existing literature on EEG-controlled prosthetic arms, and learn about the different techniques that have been used to translate EEG and EMG signals into control signals for the prosthetic.<br><br>
    <b>Data collection and processing</b>: Collect EEG data from a subject using an EEG headset, and process the data to extract features that can be used to control the prosthetic arm. Commonly used features include power in different frequency bands and event-related potentials. The EMG sensor fits on top of the bicep of the arm for understanding muscle movements.<br><br>
   <b>Feature classification</b>: Train a classifier algorithm to recognize different patterns in the EEG data, which will be used to control the prosthetic arm. Commonly used algorithms include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. We aim to build our own algorithm understanding BFS and DFS to construct a sophisticated environment. know more about the progress here.<br><br>
   <b>Control signal generation</b>: Use the output of the classifier to generate control signals for the prosthetic arm. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as signal thresholding or smoothing, depending on the requirements of the prosthetic and the properties of the classifier. Using Arduino microcontrollers and other bluetooth modules for transmitting signals from EEG and some jumper wires for the EMG sensor.<hr>
<b style="font-size: large; text-decoration: underline;">Hardware and software integration</b>:<br> We intend to design a sophisticated <b>transradial prosthetic arm</b> using a propriteary mechanism for the arm that doesn't feel artificial and we push the limits to make it feel like an actual extension of the body. Also, looking into the existing materails used for 3D printing, we want to bring out a different fabrication as well. As discussed above, the prosthetic hand must be able to mimic the natural movements and functions of a human hand, which requires a thorough understanding of mechanics and kinematics. The project also involves the integration of various mechanical components such as gears, motors, and actuators to make the prosthetic hand function smoothly and efficiently. The design of the prosthetic hand must also consider factors such as durability, weight, and ergonomics to ensure optimal performance and user comfort.
