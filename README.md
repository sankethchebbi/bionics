# Capstone for team _Beyond Bionics_
Transradial Prosthesis - A bionic arm controlled via EEG and EMG sensors and signals.

We're a bunch of enthusiastic engineers working on the development of a transradial prosthesis, a bionic arm controlled via EEG and EMG signals. 
Our goal is to create a device that allows amputees to regain control over their limbs and improve their quality of life.
We are passionate about using cutting-edge technology to help people with disabilities and excited to be at the forefront of this field. 
With a strong background in Bioengineering and Mechanical Design, we are confident that this project will make a significant impact in the lives of those who use it.
